To solve the given problem, we can use the A* search algorithm, which is a widely used algorithm in pathfinding and graph traversal.
It is a heuristic search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a given start node and end node.

Here is the algorithm we can use to solve the given problem:

Define the grid and the drone objects with their starting and ending positions.
For each drone, calculate the time taken to reach its destination using the Manhattan distance between the starting and ending positions, assuming the drone moves only in the 4-adjacent directions.
Sort the list of drones in increasing order of their start time.
For each drone, run the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from its starting position to the destination position, taking into account the positions of all other drones at each time step. To avoid collisions, we can add a penalty to the cost function for each node that is occupied by another drone at that time step.
Store the path for each drone and move on to the next drone until all drones have been processed.
Output the paths for each drone.


Approach:

To simulate the algorithm, we can use a programming language like Python and implement the A* search algorithm using a suitable data structure like a priority queue or heap. We can visualize the paths of the drones on a 2D grid using a library like Matplotlib or Pygame. We can also test the algorithm with different inputs and compare the results with the expected outputs to verify its correctness.
For coding, I'll be using Python and Pygame library for visualization.
To input the dynamic data, I'll be taking input from a CSV file.
I'll be using the A* algorithm to solve the problem.
To run the code, follow the below steps:

Install Python and Pygame library.
Download the code from Github.
Open the command prompt and go to the project directory.
Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required libraries.
Create a CSV file with the following columns: Start_X, Start_Y, End_X, End_Y, Start_Time. Add the data for each drone in the rows.
Run the command "python main.py" to start the program.
Enter the file name (including the extension) when prompted.
The program will show the paths of the drones on the Pygame window.
